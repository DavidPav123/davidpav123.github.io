            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano or 1 leaf fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 bell or poblano peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the beans (450g), salt (2 tbsp.), and water (2L) into a
                large container or bowl. Let beans soak overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add dry chipotle peppers (2), arbol chilies (4), cumin (1 1/2
                tbsp.), cloves (2), and coriander (1 1/2 tsp.) to a large pot on
                medium heat. Toast spices and chilies until they turn fragrant
                and begin to brown slightly. Add one cup of chicken broth to the
                pot and simmer everything until the chilies begin to soften and
                rehydrate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the chilies begin to soften and rehydrate, add everything
                from the pot to a blender. Additionally, add tomato paste (2
                tbsp.), coffee grounds (1 tbsp.), soy sauce (1 tbsp.), garlic
                cloves (4), oregano (1 tbsp.), and crushed tomatoes (28oz). Mix
                on high until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the beans and discard the soaking water. Dice the onion and
                add it to the pot along with vegetable oil (4 tbsp.). Cook
                onions on medium heat until they begin to brown. Once the onions
                begin to brown add the blended sauce and the beans, mix thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn heat to medium low and simmer the bens for 3-4 hours until the beans become tender.
                In the mean time dice the bell or poblano peppers. Place the diced peppers on a baking sheet
                and broil until the peppers begin to blacken. Add the blackened peppers to the chili pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the beans have softened the chili is ready to eat.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Beans: I typically use pinto beans but I've also made the recipe
                with soybeans, kidney beans, and a mix of beans. I'm sure any
                bean will work but pinto beans add a nice thickness to the
                chili.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toppings: Pairs well with shredded cheese and cilantro. 
            </li>
        </ul>
