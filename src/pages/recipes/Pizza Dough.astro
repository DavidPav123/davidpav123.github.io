        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl and mix. Once
                ingredients are evenly spread throughout, add olive oil and
                water. Mix until no flour is visible then knead for a minute
                until the dough starts to become taught.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the dough and let rise for 30 minutes at room temperature.
                After 30 minutes has passed knead the dough again, cover, and
                let rest for 30 more minutes. After 30 minutes the dough is
                ready to bake.
            </li>
            <li>
                To cook: Preheat the oven to its hottest setting. Spread the
                pizza dough on a oiled and lightly floured pizza pan or other
                baking sheet, top with sauce, cheese, and other toppings and put
                into the oven. When many spots of dark brown cheese have
                appeared on the top of the pizza its ready to be taken out of
                the oven.
            </li>
