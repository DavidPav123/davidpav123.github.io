        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 sheets rice paper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the rice paper sheets into quarters. Cut the quarter pieces
                into 1 inch wide strips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the strips into a dish and pour the sesame oil over. Using
                chopsticks or your hands, spread the sesame oil over the strips,
                this will help them to not stick together when wet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the tablespoons of soy sauce, vinegar, and water over the
                strips and mix. Let the strips sit. Once most of the liquid has
                been soaked up and the strips have softened they are ready to
                eat.
            </li>
        </ol>
